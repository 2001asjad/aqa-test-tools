<!-- Benchmarks list for the XUL launcher.
	 Notes on the syntax:
	 
	 Each benchmark element must have the name and variant attributes defined.
	 
	 The setup attribute instructs the Axxon job creation process to generate
	 setup jobs for that benchmark. Typically, perffarm benchmarks require setup
	 jobs. Large benchmarks (such as WAS) are pre-installed and thus do not have
	 a setup step.
	 
	 Each benchmark has a set of capabilities and a set of properties:
	  - Capabilities restrict a benchmark to running on a machine that provides
	 that capability. Capabilities defined against a machine may carry a set of
	 property values specific to that machine.
	  - Properties provide default values used to construct the benchmark job,
	  which may be modified by the user through the XUL launcher. They may
	  optionally be qualified by the 'bits' attribute, which restricts that
	  property to apply only when a matching platform is selected.
	  
	  A benchmark may be restricted to a subset of platforms - in which case,
	  there should be a platforms element with separate platform subelements
	  containing the 'type' of platform (eg. WindowsIA32) as defined in
	  platforms.xml. If no platforms element is present, the benchmark will be
	  available on all platforms.
	  
	  The iterations element specifies the default number of iterations for
	  that benchmark (this can be overridden by the user in the launcher).
